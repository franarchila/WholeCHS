I’ll never forget the first time I heard about cryotherapy. It was when I watching E News and hearing the latest on Lindsay Lohan’s weight loss updates. Apparently, she was one of Hollywood’s first to try out cryotherapy.  “You can burn 600 calories in 3 minutes with temperatures below 200 degrees F!”… um WHAT! I immediately googled more about it and was intrigued but turned off because I HATE being cold.

Flash forward 3.5 years later and CryoEvolution opened up in Charleston. Again, I was intrigued, but honestly thought I would be one of those freak cases where I passed out and froze to death in the chamber because I couldn’t bear the freezing temperatures. A few months after opening, the owner reached out to me to see if I wanted to come in and try it because of its many holistic benefits. After going back and forth, I finally agreed to make a visit, ironically in the middle of winter after Charleston’s random snow storm.  I was really sore at the time and desperate to relieve some of that inflammation, so figured why not.

I walked in and was greeted by the nicest staff. There was also another frequent customer there who was so excited to get their freeze on, which was comforting to see as a nervous first timer. I was BEYOND nervous and explained my hate for cold, but was comforted and assured that everything would be fine. The staff walked me through some of the benefits that would happen as my body heated itself back up post submerging myself into a -200 to -250F chamber for 1-3 minutes. These included:

* A release of endorphins
* Increased circulation
* Decreased inflammation by clearing toxins, lactic acid, & metabolic waste
* Afterburn effect where body metabolizes additional calories
* Improved sleep
* Muscle recovery

After changing into a robe, socks, gloves, and slippers, it was my time to enter. I stepped into the chamber, took off my robe, and then waited / panicked and made the staff talk to me / distract me from what was going on. I paced back and forth trying to warm myself up as my body started to get cold. Although I was literally in freezing temperatures, this kind of cold felt more like a “dry” cold, and was somewhat bearable. After a minute or so, my thighs and calves felt a numbing and almost prickly sensation which they said was completely normal. I asked over and over, “how much time is left?!” and kept pacing. (Hindsight – the next time I will try deep breathing) I made it 2 minutes and 30 seconds, then demanded to come out.

The immediate post freeze sensation reminded me of being a kid that played in the snow all day and had just come inside for hot chocolate. After being out for 2-3 minutes, I started to feel AMAZING. I was in the best mood, felt SO energized, and more flexible. Honestly every time I get in a bad mood now I think, “I should go get a freeze” because the post endorphin boost is real. I also felt less sore than I did earlier in the day, and was able to return to working out the next day. I was very impressed and no longer skeptical of cryotherapy after finally giving in and trying.

Since then, I convinced three of my friends, that teach the LO classes at HYLO Fitness, to come in for a freeze. They instantly became hooked. Here’s what they had to say:

“I loved my experiences at CryoEvolution. The staff is super friendly and helps you get through the sessions to make it to the optimum time so you can get all the benefits of Cryo. I felt invigorated and energized after my freeze and slept so well that night. It's fun and adventurous and the benefits are really cool. It's easy to drop by, freeze, and head out.” - Jamie

“I was unsure what to expect, but after my first two freezes, I immediately noticed a reduction in chronic muscle and joint pain I had been experiencing for years and a drastic reduction in recovery time post workouts from treating sore muscles.  Not only have I felt more energized through the day, been getting better nights sleep, but I’m more able to maintain my health and fitness goals through optimal muscular recovery from cryo sessions.” - Marissa

“I was a little unsure about the freeze at first but it is similar to an ice bath which I’m used to from college.  I lasted 2 Min 45 seconds.  A few minutes after I got out, I could feel the difference.  I was more energized and more flexible immediately after (I tested that). I also believe that it increases sexual drive (I tested that too) ha. The second real time I froze was unreal.  I lasted 2 Min 36 seconds and before I went in, I was tired and cranky.  After I went straight to HYLO to work out and I had SO much energy and was SO happy!!! I am now obsessed! This place rocks!

My most recent experience made me a full on believer. I had somehow injured my shoulder, was supposed to get a massage, but unfortunately mixed up my appointment. Luckily CRYO was nearby, so I hopped on in, did a 3 minute freeze, and was out of there within 10 min. I kid you not I felt like a BRAND new person. I could sit up and bend down, which I had been unable to all morning, felt SO energized, and finally got some of the aches out of my shoulder! I definitely think everyone should check cryoevolution out!! It’s a great post workout recovery and mood booster if ya need a pick me up!

(P.S. if you go after reading this post, say Fran from wholechsliving referred ya – you’ll get a $15 first freeze!)
